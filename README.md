## üìä Dataset

This project utilizes the **Bangalore City Traffic Dataset** from Kaggle, which captures detailed traffic patterns across major roads and intersections in Bangalore. The dataset includes:

- **Traffic Volume**: Number of vehicles at specific locations
- **Average Speed**: Speed of traffic flow
- **Congestion Level**: Level of traffic congestion
- **Area Name**: Geographic area in Bangalore
- **Road/Intersection Name**: Specific road or intersection
- **Travel Time Index**: Relative travel time compared to free-flow conditions
- **Incident Reports**: Number of traffic incidents
- **Road Capacity Utilization**: Percentage of road capacity being used
- **Weather Conditions**: Weather during measurement
- **Environmental Impact**: Environmental metrics

**Dataset Source**: [Bangalore City Traffic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/preethamgouda/banglore-city-traffic-dataset)

## üìì Notebook Structure

The `Traffic_conjestion.ipynb` notebook is organized into the following sections:

### 1. Introduction and Data Loading
- Dataset import from Kaggle using `kagglehub`
- Initial data exploration and setup
- Data loading and preprocessing

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The notebook includes 9 comprehensive visualizations:

#### **2.1 Heat Map**
- Visualizes traffic volume across different areas and intersections
- **Key Insight**: Koramangala and Indiranagar show consistently high traffic volumes

#### **2.2 SunBurst Chart**
- Hierarchical view of traffic patterns by area and road/intersection
- **Key Insight**: Major areas like Koramangala and Indiranagar have multiple high-traffic intersections

#### **2.3 Scatter Plot**
- Relationship between traffic volume and average speed
- Color-coded by congestion level
- **Key Insight**: Inverse relationship between traffic volume and average speed; higher volume leads to slower speeds

#### **2.4 Box Plot**
- Distribution of Travel Time Index across different areas
- **Key Insight**: Koramangala shows high variability in travel times, indicating inconsistent traffic conditions

#### **2.5 Pie Chart**
- Distribution of incident reports across areas
- **Key Insight**: M.G. Road and Koramangala account for the majority of traffic incidents

#### **2.6 Histogram**
- Distribution of road capacity utilization
- **Key Insight**: Many roads operate at or near full capacity, indicating infrastructure strain

#### **2.7 Radial Bar Chart**
- Average congestion levels by area
- **Key Insight**: M.G. Road and Koramangala have consistently high congestion levels

#### **2.8 Density Plot**
- Traffic volume vs. average speed density contours
- **Key Insight**: Most traffic operates within specific speed and volume ranges

#### **2.9 Stacked Bar Chart**
- Traffic volume by weather conditions across areas
- **Key Insight**: Clear weather sees higher traffic volumes, suggesting weather-dependent travel patterns

### 3. K-Means Clustering Analysis

Machine learning approach to identify traffic pattern clusters:

#### **Data Preparation**
- Feature selection of relevant traffic metrics
- Data standardization using `StandardScaler`
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

#### **Elbow Method**
- Determines optimal number of clusters (k)
- Visualizes inertia across different k values

#### **Clustering Results**

**Cluster 0 - Moderate Traffic Areas:**
- Lower traffic volumes
- Moderate congestion levels
- Road capacity utilization: 75-80%
- Lower environmental impact
- Represents less urbanized or off-peak areas

**Cluster 1 - High Congestion Areas:**
- Higher traffic volumes
- Elevated congestion levels
- Higher road capacity utilization
- Greater environmental impact
- Represents highly urbanized, congested areas

#### **Visualization**
- Multi-panel visualization showing distribution of various metrics across clusters
- Includes traffic volume, average speed, congestion level, capacity utilization, and more

### 4. Rule-Based Inference

- Aggregates traffic data by area and road
- Calculates mean values for key metrics
- Provides rule-based insights for traffic management

## üéØ Key Findings

1. **Geographic Hotspots**: Koramangala, Indiranagar, and M.G. Road are primary congestion areas
2. **Traffic Patterns**: Clear inverse relationship between traffic volume and average speed
3. **Infrastructure Utilization**: Many roads operate at or near full capacity
4. **Incident Correlation**: High-traffic areas also show higher incident rates
5. **Weather Impact**: Traffic patterns vary significantly with weather conditions
6. **Cluster Insights**: Two distinct traffic pattern clusters identified - moderate and high congestion areas

## üöÄ Usage

### Running the Analysis

1. **Execute cells sequentially**: The notebook is designed to run from top to bottom
2. **Data Import**: First cell downloads the dataset from Kaggle
3. **EDA Section**: Run all visualization cells to see interactive plots
4. **ML Section**: Execute clustering cells to reproduce machine learning analysis

### Customization

You can modify the analysis by:
- Changing visualization parameters (colors, chart types)
- Adjusting the number of clusters in K-Means
- Adding additional features to the clustering analysis
- Implementing different machine learning algorithms

## üìà Visualizations

The notebook generates interactive visualizations using Plotly, including:
- Heat maps
- Sunburst charts
- Scatter plots
- Box plots
- Pie charts
- Histograms
- Radial bar charts
- Density contour plots
- Stacked bar charts

All visualizations are interactive and can be zoomed, panned, and explored.
